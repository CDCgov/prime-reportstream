## Overview

The PRIME data hub project is the part of the Pandemic Ready Interoperable Modernization Effort that works with state and local public health departments. The project is a joint effort between the CDC and USDS. Currently, we are focusing on the problem of delivering COVID-19 test data to public health departments. Later, we will work on other tools to analyze and explore this data and different types of health data.

Other PRIME repositories include

- [PRIME-Central](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-central): a place we keep common files and documents
- [PRIME-Data-Input-Client](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-data-input-client): The POC COVID-19 test data input application that will use the data router
