# Rules of Behavior and Posting Guidelines for the Use of GitHub as a Third-Party Web Application

## Purpose

These rules of behavior establish the privacy and information security requirements for the use of Third Party Web Applications (TPWAs) in conjunction with the CDC GitHub.com organizations established for open source projects. These rules of behavior were developed to ensure that CDC and its confidential information and technologies are not compromised, as well as protecting general CDC interests and services from risks associated with the use of TPWAs while allowing for the increased efficiencies and cost savings that come with appropriate use of third party services.

## Scope

These rules of behavior and its related guidance apply to federal employees, contractors, and all external collaborators who will access GitHub from CDC directly or use them with non-sensitive data obtained from CDC.  All engagement with TPWAs related to the GitHub will be governed by these rules of behavior, as well as to the Rules of Behavior for the Use of HHS Information Services.

## Ownership

CDC assigns three stewards in charge of rules and policy compliance: a Business Steward, a Security Steward, and a Technical Steward. The business and security stewards are responsible for establishing policy and providing approval, while the technical steward fulfills requests from users. Users requesting access to GitHub that have not been approved yet need to assign a main and a backup point of contact (POC) with the business steward, as well as provide a justification to the security steward.

The security steward is responsible for the security of the GitHub usage as a TPWA and its impact on the CDC network and compliance with CDC security policies. All users, including POCs, are responsible for adherence to this policy and associated processes. Where there is not a rule of behavior that provides explicit guidance, users must do their best to safeguard CDC and its network and services from security risks.

## Rules of Behavior

All new users of GitHub must read and acknowledge these rules before using any of the approved TPWAs. This acknowledgment must be completed annually, and establishes agreement from part of the user to adhere to these rules.

* I understand that I must complete security awareness and records management training annually in order to comply with the latest security and records management policies.
* I understand that I must also follow the Rules of Behavior for use of HHS Information Resources.
* I understand that I must not use, share, or store any kind of sensitive data (health status, provision or payment of healthcare, pictures, PII, etc.) with TPWAs under ANY circumstance.
* I will not knowingly conceal, falsify or remove information.This includes editing or removing the template language provided when a Github repository is created.
* I understand that I can only use non-sensitive and/or publicly available data in GitHub. If you are unsure of what constitutes non-sensitive information, please see guidance below.
* I understand that all passwords I create to set up GitHub accounts need to comply with CDC’s password policy.
* I understand that the steward reserves the right to moderate all data at any time.
* I understand my responsibilities to protect systems and data as specified by CDC policies.

## Guidance Regarding Non-Sensitive and Publicly Available Information

In support of program collaboration in the use oF GitHub, portions of some GitHub projects are either currently open to the public or may become open to the public in the future. The following guidelines will inform and assist the user in determining that the information to be posted on GitHub is not sensitive. The bottom line is if the content you are posting is not appropriate to post for public access, it should not be posted on GitHub.

Before posting information that involves other CDC programs, employees, etc. to GitHub, it is important that the poster ensures they receive approval by the relevant CDC entity to post the information.

Questions to consider before posting information include:

| Do I have reservations about anyone viewing this information?                                                     | Yes | Do not post. |
| Were individuals informed that this information would be posted on GitHub?                                        | No  | Do not post. |
| Does this information contain details or descriptions of CDC security systems or other sensitive infrastructures? | Yes | Do not post. |
| Does this information reflect program efforts to engage and inform external partners and the public?              | No  | Do not post. |

Examples of information which has been deemed not sensitive and may be posted on GitHub include the following.

* Source Code
* Use cases
* User stories/requirements
* Process flows
* Program pain points
* Software Service Descriptions
 
Sensitive information, which should not be posted, includes (but is not limited to) the following.

* Information directly attributed to an individual in a sensitive manner
* The names or pictures of individuals
* Protected health information
* Project management material. This includes posting or discussing security documentation, implementation plans, communications regarding project specifics, etc.
* Opinions related to programs or tools, specifically those that may have an adverse impact
* Non-public Links to CDC SharePoint or other internal references
* Non-public Details on CDC internal infrastructure

If there’s any question on whether information may be sensitive (such as detailed interview notes or specific references provided during a program interview), further guidance should be sought from the security steward prior to posting the information on any GitHub. 

## Enforcement

Users looking to use GitHub  that are unable to follow these rules of behavior will not have authorization to do so. Any users that violate these rules of behavior or CDC security policies may be subject to action, up to and including revoking access to GitHub. Technical and security stewards have the right to enforce these rules of behavior based on violations at any time.
