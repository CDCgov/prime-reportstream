                    If you've decided you'll need an ELR connection for your

                    from you on your needs and requirements. Connecting with
                    ReportStream is similar to setting up an ELR feed with a lab
                    or hospital, and takes just a few steps.

                    New testing facilities join ReportStream on a regular basis,
                    through our partner SimpleReport, or through other public
                    health data aggregators and apps. After they join, their
                    data will be sent automatically to the correct public health
                    department(s) in their jurisdiction who are part of
                    ReportStream. Data is accessible via our web application or
                    the ELR connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can request a weekly email update from ReportStream to
                    notify you when new facilities join in your jurisdiction,
                    and let us know if you have any special requirements for
                    them to complete before they join.
