            <p>
                An Electronic Lab Reporting (ELR) connection allows public
                health authorities to automatically receive digital lab reports
                from ReportStream via a secure server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Connecting to ReportStream is similar to setting up an ELR feed
                with a lab or hospital. There are just three steps:

                        As part of kick-off, you'll share your SFTP server
                        credentials. We'll then send test files and ensure the
                        test data arrives correctly in your database.

                        we'll continually batch and send you only the data
                        relevant to your jurisdiction.

            </h3>
            <p>
                New testing facilities join ReportStream on a regular basis
                through our partner SimpleReport or through other public health
                data aggregators and apps. After they join, their data will be
                sent automatically to the correct public health department(s) in
                their jurisdiction who are part of ReportStream. Data is
                accessible via the ReportStream website or the ELR connection.
