                    All ReportStream data is encrypted in transit and rest using
                    a TLS 1.2+ Azure standard. It is routed through a CDC cloud
                    environment, where it is deleted after 30 days. Additional
                    encryption can be provided if required by public health
                    departments.

                    ReportStream uses a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
                    standard Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) connection.
                    Public health departments using the ReportStream ELR can
                    request data be sent in real time, or batched according to
                    your needs.

                <p>
                    Public health departments can request alternative transport
                    platforms such as VPN, PHINMS, SOAP, etc. Setting up
                    alternative formats is possible, but requires more time
