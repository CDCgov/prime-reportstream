  <h2>Using the Web Receiver</h2>
  <h3>Recommended browser</h3>

  <p>Please use a modern desktop web browser (ex: <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Safari</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Edge</a>) to access the Web Receiver site. Please note: the application does not support Internet Explorer 11 or below.</p>


  <h3>General usage</h3>

  <h4>Account creation</h4>
  <p>ReportStream is utilizing a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/" className="usa-link">Health and Human Services</a> owned <a href="https://okta.com">Okta</a> account for managing access to the application. Okta is a U.S. based cloud software provider that specializes in access and identity management.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You will receive an email from Okta prompting you to sign up.</li>
    <li>Follow the link in the email to set up your account.</li>
    <li>Choose a strong password.</li>
    <li>Choose a two factor authentication method.
      <ul className="margin-top-1">
        <li>For increased security, two-factor authentication is required.</li>
        <li>You can use either SMS or Google Authenticator (<a
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605" className="usa-link">App Store</a>, <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US"
            className="usa-link">Google Play</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Sign in to the application</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Visit <a href="/login/" className="usa-link">reportstream.cdc.gov</a> to log in to the application.</li>
      <li>If you are directed to an internal Okta page and not the data download site, donâ€™t worry! Visit <a href="/daily/" className="usa-link">reportstream.cdc.gov/daily-data</a> to view your data.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Accessing data</h4>
  <p>You will have the option to download a CSV of the most recently reported test result data for the day, as well as
    download up to 30 days of previously reported data. After 30 days has passed for each file, test results will
    be permanently deleted from ReportStream as per our retention policy.</p>

  <h4>Account management</h4>
  <p>ReportStream will manually manage user accounts for your team. To add or remove team members, email us at <a
      href="mailto:reportstream@cdc.gov" className="usa-link">reportstream@cdc.gov</a>.</p>

    <h4>Password reset</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If you forgot your password, follow the instructions under "Need help signing in?" on the login page at <a
          href="/login/" className="usa-link">reportsream.cdc.gov/login</a>.</li>
      <li>If you want to update your password, log out of the application and use the password reset process outlined
        above.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data retention</h4>
    <p>Due to the presence of personally identifiable information or personal health information, ReportStream will not
      be a permanent repository for reported test data.</p>
    <p>Each day's report will be held for 30 days, and will be accessible through the application for the duration of
      that period. After 30 days has passed for an individual report, the file will be permanently deleted and will
      not be recoverable.</p>
    <p>Please download data and ingest it into your systems as soon as possible.</p>
