                            PRIME ReportStream infrastructure, including but not
                            limited to reportable public health data as well as

                            disease, supply of personal protective equipment,

                            territorial public health authority (STLT Public

                            enrolled in and using ReportStream to transmit
                            and/or receive Public Health Data.

                            ReportStream will only designate one User from the

                            PRIME ReportStream is provided by HHS and CDC to
                            enable a User to send Public Health Data, including

                            COVID-19. Use of PRIME ReportStream is subject to
                            these Terms of Service and use of PRIME ReportStream
                            constitutes acceptance of these Terms.

                        <p>
                            If you are using PRIME ReportStream on behalf of an

                            authority to bind that Entity to the Terms and by
                            accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of
                            that Entity (and all references to “you” in the
                            Terms refer to you and that Entity).

                            You may be required to provide certain information
                            (such as identification or contact details) to
                            access PRIME ReportStream, as part of the

                            your continued use of PRIME ReportStream. Any such
                            registration information you give to CDC or HHS must
                            be accurate and up-to-date, and you must inform us
                            promptly of any updates so that we can keep you
                            informed of any changes to PRIME ReportStream or
                            these Terms which may impact your usage of PRIME
                            ReportStream. Upon registration and the creation of

                            are using. You agree to keep your credentials
                            confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent
                            and discourage other persons from using your

                            Entity Users who are added and to inactivate any
                            other Entity Users who should no longer have access.
                            The Administrator also agrees to set permissions
                            appropriately to determine the minimum access
                            necessary for each other Entity User to complete

                            the Public Health Data is requested of CDC, CDC
                            shall notify the requestor that CDC does not have

                        <p>
                            Your use of PRIME ReportStream may be subject to
                            certain limitations on access or use as set forth
                            within these Terms or otherwise provided by CDC.
                            These limitations are designed to manage the load on
                            the system, promote equitable access, and ensure
                            appropriate privacy and security protections and
                            these limitations may be adjusted without notice, as
                            deemed necessary by CDC. If CDC reasonably believes
                            that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent
                            these limits, your ability to use PRIME ReportStream
                            may be temporarily or permanently blocked. CDC may
                            monitor your use of PRIME ReportStream to improve
                            the service or to ensure compliance with these Terms
                            and reserves the right to deny any User access to
                            PRIME ReportStream at its reasonable discretion.

                        <p>
                            If you wish to terminate your access to and use of
                            PRIME ReportStream, you may do so by deactivating
                            your account or by refraining from further use of
                            PRIME ReportStream.

                        <p>
                            CDC reserves the right (though not the obligation)
                            to: (1) refuse to provide PRIME ReportStream to you,
                            if it is CDC’s opinion that use violates any federal
                            law or CDC policy; or (2) terminate or deny you
                            access to and use of all or part of PRIME
                            ReportStream at any time for any reason which in
                            CDC’s sole discretion it deems necessary, including
                            to prevent violation of federal law or CDC policy.
                            You may submit a request to CDC to regain access to
                            PRIME ReportStream through the support email address
                            provided by CDC for PRIME ReportStream. If CDC
                            determines in its sole discretion that the
                            circumstances which led to the refusal to provide
                            PRIME ReportStream or terminate access to PRIME
                            ReportStream no longer exist, then CDC may restore
                            your access. All provisions of these Terms, which by
                            their nature should survive termination, shall
                            survive termination including, without limitation,
                            warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
