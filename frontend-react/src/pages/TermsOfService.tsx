<h1 className="margin-top-0">Terms of service – PRIME ReportStream</h1>

<p className="bold italic">Updated 5/10/2021</p>

<p>As a User accessing or using the PRIME ReportStream infrastructure provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for and shall abide by these Terms of Service, as well as any relevant sections of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/other/information.html" className="usa-link">CDC’s Privacy Policies</a> (collectively, Terms).</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>Entity: A health care provider or facility; testing site; state, local, tribal, and territorial public health authorities (STLT Public Health Agencies); or other organization that is enrolled in and using ReportStream to transmit and/or receive ReportStream Data.</p>

<p>User: Individual authorized to act on behalf of the Entity under these Terms. ReportStream will only designate one User from the Entity as the Administrator. Administrators will have more detailed identity verification than general Entity Users. Once the Administrator has their identity verified, the Administrator can add other general Entity Users to the Application. Both roles are referred to as “User” for the purposes of these Terms.</p>

<p>ReportStream Data: Electronic public health information transmitted using the PRIME ReportStream infrastructure, including but not limited to all optional and required notifiable and reportable public health disease information as well as information required in a public health emergency, such as hospitalizations related to a particular disease, supply of personal protective equipment, etc.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>PRIME ReportStream works with state and local public health departments to enable the exchange of public health information including personally identifiable information (PII) for authorized public health activities. PRIME ReportStream is being provided by HHS and CDC to enable a User to send ReportStream Data to STLT Public Health Agencies in furtherance of public health response activities related to COVID-19. Use of PRIME ReportStream is subject to these Terms of Service and use of PRIME ReportStream constitutes acceptance of these Terms.</p>

<h2>Data rights and usage</h2>

<h3>Accounts/registration</h3>

<p>If you are using PRIME ReportStream on behalf of an Entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that Entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that Entity (and all references to “you” in the Terms refer to you and that Entity).</p>

<p>In order to access PRIME ReportStream, as part of the registration process for PRIME ReportStream, and for your continued use of PRIME ReportStream, you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details). Any such registration information you give to CDC or HHS must be accurate and up-to-date, and you must inform us promptly of any updates so that we can keep you informed of any changes to PRIME ReportStream or these Terms which may impact your usage of PRIME ReportStream. Upon registration and the creation of User accounts within PRIME ReportStream, credentials (such as passwords, keys, tokens, and User identifications (IDs)) will be issued to you by CDC. These credentials are intended to be used only by you and to identify any software or APIs which you are using. You agree to keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other persons from using your credentials.</p>

<p>*For Administrators*: The Administrator agrees to verify identity of other Entity Users who are added and to inactivate any other Entity Users who should no longer have access. The Administrator also agrees to set permissions appropriately to determine the minimum access necessary for each other Entity User to complete their required job duties.</p>

<p>*For all Users*: As noted above, Entity Users, both Administrators and other Entity Users, agree to accept and comply with these Terms once you register and use PRIME ReportStream.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>You may use PRIME ReportStream to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view and otherwise ‘get’ information from data you are sending via PRIME ReportStream and the Platform. Please note that the data which you are sending via PRIME ReportStream may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and other laws, and may require special safeguarding. By accessing and using PRIME ReportStream, you agree to strictly abide by all applicable federal and state laws regarding the collection, use, confidentiality, protection and disclosure of information obtained or sent through PRIME ReportStream. If you would like more information about the application of the Privacy Act at CDC, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/Privacy/PrivacyActof1974.html" className="usa-link">click here</a>.</p>

<p>For purposes of use of PRIME ReportStream, if you are a HIPAA-covered entity or acting on behalf of one as a business associate or if the data is maintained in a HIPAA-covered designated record set, you further acknowledge that you will abide by applicable HIPAA regulations (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164) for purposes of appropriate storage, transmission, use and disclosure of any protected health information.</p>

<h3>Use of data</h3>

<p>PRIME ReportStream is being provided in order to allow for the transmission of relevant data to STLT Public Health Agencies to facilitate authorized public health activities. HHS and CDC acknowledge that CDC, through PRIME ReportStream, is acting as a conduit for transmission of ReportStream Data for the purposes of public health reporting and does not intend to take custody or control of ReportStream Data. The User acknowledges and agrees that CDC may address gaps in the ReportStream Data during the transmission process, for the limited purpose of addressing data quality issues. Except as may be required by applicable federal law, CDC may not use or disclose the ReportStream Data for other purposes than described in these Terms of Service. As noted, generally, CDC does not intend to take custody or control of the ReportStream Data; where the data is not in CDC's custody and control and the ReportStream Data is requested of CDC, CDC shall notify the requestor that CDC does not have custody of this data and refer requestor to the Entity.</p>

<h3>Sharing of data</h3>

<p>Data recorded and stored in PRIME ReportStream is for use by the User as needed for authorized public health activities, including transmission of public health data for reporting purposes. To meet applicable reporting requirements, ReportStream Data will be made available to the appropriate STLT Public Health Agency based on location, with all relevant fields including but not limited to: case reporting, lab results, hospitalizations, and vaccine administration.</p>

<p>By entering information that is being reported to STLT Public Health Agency, the User attests that it is authorized to report the data using PRIME ReportStream. Users, either directly or in coordination with the relevant STLT Public Health Agency, may decide to use PRIME ReportStream to send de-identified or other appropriate and/or agreed upon levels of data to CDC for public health purposes; such data sent to CDC will be maintained consistent with applicable federal laws.</p>

<h3>Other responsibilities</h3>

<li>In the event that a security breach impacts PRIME ReportStream, you will be required to notify individuals whose individually identifiable or protected health information is in PRIME ReportStream and have been impacted by the breach. Assistance may be offered by CDC to aid in this process.</li>
