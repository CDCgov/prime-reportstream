### SimpleReport

Our network expands beyond the organizations directly using ReportStream and includes the testing sites
and providers using SimpleReport as well. Data reported by using [SimpleReport](https://www.simplereport.gov),
our sister project from the CDC, is sent to public health agencies through ReportStream.
