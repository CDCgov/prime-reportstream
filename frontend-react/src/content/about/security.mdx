        content:(<>
            <p>As a project of the U.S. federal government, ReportStream complies with the <A href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/fisma-background">Federal Information Security Modernization Act</A> (FISMA). FISMA sets standards and requires federal agencies to implement information security plans to protect sensitive data.</p>
            <p>FISMA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) set the FISMA <A href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management">compliance guidelines</A>. Specifically, NIST guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set minimum requirements for information security plans and procedures.</li>
                <li>Recommend security systems, software, and similar technology that agencies must implement and approve.</li>
                <li>Standardize the risk assessment process and set varying standards of information security based on agency risk assessments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As part of the FISMA process, ReportStream has full authorization to operate (ATO), granted by CDC's Chief Information Officer/Authorizing Official. The extensive review involved documenting over 500 security controls, reviews by multiple teams, and penetration testing by third parties.</p>

            For business and security purposes, ReportStream keeps logs of activity. One of these logs is an audit trail of all test results sent to ReportStream and all receivers of data from ReportStream. That line-level audit trail tracks the sending and receiving of each individual message, rather than the transmission of the batched or aggregated results. The audit trail is kept for multiple years.

            <p>Organizations may also designate users who can log in to the ReportStream website to view and download the data they have sent or received.
