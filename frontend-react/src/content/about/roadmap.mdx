## Objectives for FY24
Learn about our goals and how we are measuring success for this fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 2023 through September 2024.

<hr className="rs-hr--base-lighter-alternate" />

### Support public health entities with time-sensitive, reportable condition electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) data and broader response readiness.
* 100% of the 64 <A href="https://www.cdc.gov/epidemiology-laboratory-capacity/php/about/" target="_blank">ELC-funded</A> state, tribal, local, or territorial public health agencies (STLTs) are connected to ReportStream.
* At least 15 <A href="https://www.cdc.gov/epidemiology-laboratory-capacity/php/about/" target="_blank">ELC-funded</A> STLTs receive live data for two or more reportable conditions from ReportStream via ELR.
* Complete connection updates for all STLTs currently receiving COVID data so they are able to receive more conditions.
* Begin updating the connection of organizations sending COVID data so they are able to send additional conditions through ReportStream.
* Identify one or more new health care organizations, labs, or testing facilities for collaboration on their data reporting needs.

### Pilot faster, simpler electronic test orders and results (ETOR) data transfer with federal and state public health labs.
* Complete successful test delivery of ELR from CDCâ€™s infectious disease labs to STLTs.
* Support pilots for newborn screening ETOR with one or more hospital systems and state public health labs.
