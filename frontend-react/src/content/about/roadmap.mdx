## Objectives for FY25
Learn about our goals and how we are measuring success for this fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 2024 through September 2025.

<hr className="rs-hr--base-lighter-alternate" />

### Support public health entities with time-sensitive, reportable condition electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) data and broader response readiness.
* 100% of the 64 <A href="https://www.cdc.gov/epidemiology-laboratory-capacity/php/about/" target="_blank">ELC-funded</A> state, tribal, local, or territorial public health agencies (STLTs) are connected to ReportStream.
* Connect at least 5 new healthcare organizations to ReportStream for sending all of their reportable conditions. 
* Route lab data for at least 15 reportable conditions. 
* Complete connection updates for all healthcare organizations and STLTs currently receiving COVID data so they are able to send or receive data for more conditions.  
* Build basic functionality to allow ReportStream to ingest CSV via an API for conditions beyond COVID. 

### Facilitate simple, efficient reporting for additional core public health data sources and public health systems.
* Route hospitalization data from at least one healthcare organization to the CDC <A href="https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/index.html">National Syndromic Surveillance Program</A> (NSSP). 
* Route hospitalization data from at least one healthcare organization to one STLT. 
* Connect ReportStream to one federal healthcare system outside of the CDC. 
* Participate in CDC <A href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/index.html">One Health</A> activities and/or CDC <A href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/lrn/">Laboratory Response Network</A>. 
* Connect ReportStream to three third-party standards/services. 
* Meet the needs of senders and STLTs by routing data in accordance with the HL7 LRI/LOI spec.
