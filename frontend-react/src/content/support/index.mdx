        title: "Should I use ReportStream or SimpleReport?",
        content: (<>
If you are a public health agency, you only need to connect to ReportStream. You will get data from testing facilities who connect to ReportStream through our API and those facilities who report through SimpleReport. SimpleReport data will flow directly to you through ReportStream, so you do not need to onboard to SimpleReport.

If you are a healthcare organization, ReportStream and SimpleReport offer two different ways to send your data. ReportStream uses an API connection to send your data to public health departments. You can send an HL7 or CSV file through our API.  Some technical expertise is required to set up an API connection. If you currently send data via SFTP, this may be a process you are familiar with. Depending on your resources, capacity, and requirements, it takes about a month to establish an API connection with ReportStream.

SimpleReport can be used for manual reporting or CSV upload. Because there is no technical setup, onboarding is quicker and simpler than for ReportStream.

Both SimpleReport and ReportStream are free.

According to the CARES Act, labs are not required to report to both state or local health departments and HHS. The CARES Act requires labs to report all data to state or local public health departments using existing public health data reporting channels, in accordance with state law or policies. The public health department will provide these data to HHS.

LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) mapping provides several data elements you’ll need for your ReportStream test file. Including: 
Equipment model name
Equipment UID
Test performed code

If you do not know what devices you’ll be reporting for, contact your lab.  

When you know the devices you are reporting for, you can use the LIVD mapping table to identify the device identifier code. The code is in column F, labeled Test Performed LOINC Code. Then, you can use that code as described in our data model.
