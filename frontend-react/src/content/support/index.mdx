                            If you are a <b>public health agency</b>, you only need to connect to ReportStream.
                            You will get data from testing facilities who connect to ReportStream through our API and those
                            facilities who report through <A href="https://www.simplereport.gov">SimpleReport</A>. SimpleReport data will flow directly to you through
                            ReportStream, so you do not need to onboard to SimpleReport.
                            </p>

                            If you are a <b>healthcare organization</b>, ReportStream and SimpleReport offer two different
                            ways to send your data. ReportStream uses an API connection to send HL7 and FHIR data to public health
                            departments. Some technical expertise is required to set up an API connection. 
                            If you currently send data via SFTP, this may be a process you are familiar with.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <A href="https://www.simplereport.gov">SimpleReport</A> can be used for manual, single entry reporting or CSV
                            upload. There is no technical experience necessary to use SimpleReport.
