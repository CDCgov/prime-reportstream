                            If you are a <b>public health agency</b>, you only need to connect to ReportStream.
                            You will get data from testing facilities who connect to ReportStream through our API and those
                            facilities who report through <A href="https://www.simplereport.gov">SimpleReport</A>. SimpleReport data will flow directly to you through
                            ReportStream, so you do not need to onboard to SimpleReport.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            If you are a <b>healthcare organization</b>, ReportStream and SimpleReport offer two different
                            ways to send your data. ReportStream uses an API connection to send your data to public health
                            departments. You can send an HL7 or CSV file through our API. Some technical expertise is required
                            to set up an API connection. If you currently send data via SFTP, this may be a process you are
                            familiar with. Depending on your resources, capacity, and requirements, it takes about a month
                            to establish an API connection with ReportStream.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <A href="https://www.simplereport.gov">SimpleReport</A> can be used for manual reporting or CSV
                            upload. Because there is no technical setup, onboarding is quicker and simpler than for
                            ReportStream.
