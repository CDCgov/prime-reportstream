# Explore ReportStream and how it works

## ReportStream is a fast, free, and easy way to report COVID-19 test results and for public health departments to receive, process, and share that data across jurisdictions—all through a single connection.

---

### How ReportStream Works

Streamlining the reporting process, ReportStream allows organizations to submit data with higher quality and accuracy so that public health departments nationwide can receive greater insights for managing their COVID-19 response.

### Data Reporting

ReportStream offers two ways to deliver data directly to your public health department:

#### 1. Data download

Get verified, then simply log in to download data from our online portal. Give your team access to data from anyone in your jurisdiction that’s connected to ReportStream.

Save time with less manual data entry. Download daily data in standard HL7 or CSV format in minutes, without setting up an ELR.

#### 2. Electronic lab reporting

Get data from multiple testing facilities — in less time — through a single connection.

ReportStream works 1:1 with public health departments to make sure data arrives in the format you need, when you need it.
