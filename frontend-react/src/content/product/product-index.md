<h3 id="how"> How ReportStream receives data </h3>

ReportStream can receive report data as either comma-separated values (CSV) or Health Level 7 (HL7) files via a variety of methods. All submissions are subject to jurisdictional approval.

#### API method: Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR)

Depending on the needs of your organization or facility, ReportStream can configure an ELR connection with your existing systems. ReportStream has established connections with large organizations, test manufacturers, and facilities with advanced systems. For more information, read the [ReportStream API](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/api).

#### Single report online submission method: SimpleReport

[SimpleReport](https://www.simplereport.gov/) is a fast, free, and easy way to report test results to public health departments. Skip re-entering the same data every time you report. Just pull up a name, enter the test result, and submit. SimpleReport automatically converts your data into the format required by your public health department. Real-time reporting submits test results the moment you record them — saving you time.

#### CSV upload online submission method: SimpleReport

Use a simple online tool to submit a CSV file formatted with a standard schema. Receive real-time validation and feedback on file format and field values. [Learn how CSV upload works](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/csv-upload-guide) or read the [full schema documentation](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/csv-schema).

_This feature is currently being piloted in select jurisdictions with organizations or facilities that have existing Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems. Pilot partners are selected by recommendation from jurisdictions. Contact [SimpleReport](https://www.simplereport.gov/) to learn more about CSV upload._
