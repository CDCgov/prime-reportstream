* To assist in onboarding new labs and facilities that would like to send data through ReportStream, we have added a new resource: [Guide to Submitting Data to ReportStream](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/getting-started-submitting-data).

* In an effort to be as useful as possible to ReportStream users and visitors, we have updated the content in several items on the ReportStream resources page including: [Account Registration Guide](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/account-registration-guide), [Guide to Receiving ReportStream Data](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/getting-started-public-health-departments), [Manual Data Download Guide](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/data-download-guide).

### November 2022

See Github release notes anytime at [https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases). 

#### Improvements 

* ReportStream offers many methods to connect to public health authorities to send them data. Among them, REST/HTTP transport is fastest, most secure, and able to provide feedback. Expanding our capabilities in delivery methods enhances ReportStream’s ability to respond to future pandemics and gives us more flexibility for future data types in public health. If your jurisdiction is interested in REST/HTTP transport, [connect with our team.](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/support/contact)

* To make it easier for authenticated ReportStream users to load and view their data on the Daily Data page, we have added pagination to each page. This will display in the lower left-hand side of the page as “number of records” and as “previous” or “next” on the lower right-hand side.

#### Additional Resources 

We’re excited to announce that ReportStream has recently established connections to send and report public health data with the following state: Oklahoma.

### October 2022

See Github release notes anytime at [https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases). 

#### New Features 

* ReportStream launched a new online support center, which you can access on our website at [reportstream.cdc.gov/support](reportstream.cdc.gov/support). Submit any support requests directly to our team by filling out this form: [https://reportstream.cdc.gov/support/service-request]([url](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/support/service-request)). 

* If you are set up to download data from the ReportStream web application, you can now filter the daily data table by date range.  

#### Improvements 

Given the new mapping tool updates by the LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) team, we’ve made those additional fields available in your organization settings. This allows ReportStream users who are receiving data to adjust filters based on those fields. 

#### Additional Resources 

We’re excited to announce that ReportStream has recently established connections to send and report public health data with the following states: Indiana, Missouri, New York, and Rhode Island.
