### October 2022

See Github release notes anytime at [https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases). 

#### New Features 

* ReportStream launched a new online support center, which you can access on our website at [reportstream.cdc.gov/support](reportstream.cdc.gov/support). Submit any support requests directly to our team by filling out this form: [https://reportstream.cdc.gov/support/service-request]([url](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/support/service-request)). 

* If you are set up to download data from the ReportStream web application, you can now filter the daily data table by date range.  

#### Improvements 

Given the new mapping tool updates by the LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) team, we’ve made those additional fields available in your organization settings. This allows ReportStream users who are receiving data to adjust filters based on those fields. 

#### Additional Resources 

We’re excited to announce that ReportStream has recently established connections to send and report public health data with the following states: Indiana, Missouri, New York, and Rhode Island.
