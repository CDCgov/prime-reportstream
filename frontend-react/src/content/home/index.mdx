                    Throughout the country, a wide range of labs, testing facilities, and other healthcare organizations connect to ReportStream for their data transfer.

                    ReportStream also receives data from the expansive network of testing sites and providers using SimpleReport. [SimpleReport](https://www.simplereport.gov) is easy to use for non-traditional and under-resourced settings like schools and labs without electronic medical records. Enabling reporting from these senders empowers public health entities with more accurate and complete data.
