        - title: More test results and improved interoperability
          quote: All the people we worked with were competent and focused. I will commend the team as to how they have continued to onboard facilities and get those lab results to us timely.  Without it, we wouldn’t have received those reports at all; or, we would have had numerous pages of faxes. This initiative really improved our interoperability.
