## Onboarding at a glance

Through each step of the process, our team will make sure your connection meets your needs and gets you the public health data you require.

Connecting to ReportStream is similar to setting up an Electronic Lab Reporting (ELR) feed with a lab or hospital. Through ReportStream, you can also download data directly instead of using an ELR connection.

        <p>Before you get started, make sure you have the right team members from your organization to set up your connection. While one person can fill multiple roles, you’ll need someone who can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up a new connection with your system. This may be a networking point of contact and would be familiar with acceptable transport methods for your organization.</li>
            <li>Manage receiving data into your surveillance system or other applications you use.</li>
            <li>Evaluate ELR messages. This person may hold the title of informaticist or ELR analyst and is often the one who approves moving into production.</li>
            <li>Be a main contact for issues or questions.</li>
            <li>Make decisions on behalf of your organization and remove blockers. Often this person is a director or manager.</li>
        </ul>
