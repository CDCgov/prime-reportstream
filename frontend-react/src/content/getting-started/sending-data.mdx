        <p>Before you get started, make sure you have the right team members from your organization to set up your connection. You’ll need someone who is managing your account and a technical point of contact who knows how to set up an API connection. Sometimes one person fills both of those roles.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have someone who can set up your API connection, our sister product, <A href="https://www.simplereport.gov">SimpleReport</A>, might be able to help you.</p>

## How ReportStream sends data

<ProcessList>
<ProcessListItem>
When you submit data through our API, ReportStream automatically determines what jurisdictions need to receive it and what format it needs to be in.
</ProcessListItem>
<ProcessListItem>
ReportStream transforms data you submit into the format required by jurisdictions receiving the data. 
</ProcessListItem>
<ProcessListItem>
Data is delivered to public health agencies in the format and size they require. 
</ProcessListItem>
</ProcessList>

Multiple jurisdictions, multiple formats and requirements. Just one connection for you to manage.

### Where we send data
