## Not sure if ReportStream is the right fit for an organization?

The CDC has two free products for organizations to send data: SimpleReport and ReportStream.

- ReportStream uses an API connection to send data to public health departments. Some technical expertise is required.
- [SimpleReport](https://www.simplereport.gov) can be used for manual reporting or CSV upload and does not require technical staff.

Through ReportStream, your public health entity receives data from both ReportStream and SimpleReport users.

You can refer them to us even if you’re not certain we’re the product for them. Because we work together as CDC products, our team will help find the best product for their needs. Whether we help them connect to ReportStream or SimpleReport, you will receive their data through your ReportStream connection.
