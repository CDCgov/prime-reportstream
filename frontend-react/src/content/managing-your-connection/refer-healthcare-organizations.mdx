ReportStream supports public health entities to make sure they are getting data they need from the necessary facilities 
and organizations.  

## Referral process 

Outreach to facilities and organizations is part of onboarding to ReportStream as a public health entity. 
If you are already connected and adding more conditions, you may also use this process to get data from more organizations. 

1. Identify and contact any priority facilities or organizations. 
We provide a customizable [referral email template](#email-template) to help you with outreach and explain their options. 
ReportStream can also support outreach to organizations as needed. 
2. Then, organizations choose ReportStream or SimpleReport based on how they would like to report.  
    - Organizations who need **single entry and bulk CSV** use SimpleReport.  
    - If they are interested in an **automated, API connection in HL7 or FHIR**, they use ReportStream. 
3. After an organization contacts SimpleReport or ReportStream, our teams assist the organization with onboarding to send data. 
Learn more about [ReportStream onboarding](/getting-started/sending-data) and 
[SimpleReport onboarding](https://www.simplereport.gov/getting-started/). 

## How we work with SimpleReport  

ReportStream works with another CDC product, SimpleReport, to make sure every organization has a reporting platform that meets 
their needs. ReportStream allows healthcare organizations to use an automated, API connection to send data in HL7 and FHIR. 
If a ReportStream connection isn’t the best option for them, SimpleReport provides a way for them to report through single 
entry or CSV upload.  

Through ReportStream, public health entities receive data from organizations using ReportStream and SimpleReport to send data.

Hi [insert name of contact], 

One of our goals at [insert name of your public health agency] is to make reporting easier for you so we can make fast and 
accurate public health responses.  

As the point of contact for [insert name of organization]’s electronic lab reporting, we wanted to let you know about **free tools 
from CDC** to help you save time and resources: [ReportStream](http://reportstream.cdc.gov) and [SimpleReport](http://simplereport.gov). 

- Both platforms are free and securely deliver data where it needs to go.  
- Data will be automatically routed and transformed so public health entities receive data that meets their requirements. 
You don’t have to track the varying needs of different jurisdictions. 
- You can view file submission history. 
- On call support teams will help you as you get set up and with any issues after onboarding. 

**Which tool is right for you?** Each platform provides a different way to report data. With ReportStream, you send ELR data through an automated, API connection in HL7v2.5 or FHIR. With SimpleReport, you send data through a single entry or CSV upload.  

**Choose your platform and get started:**

- To send ELR data through HL7 or FHIR: <A href={site.forms.connectWithRS.url}>Contact ReportStream</A> and learn more at [reportstream.cdc.gov](https://reportstream.cdc.gov).

We’ve been encouraged by our work with ReportStream and SimpleReport and how they are helping other organizations. We hope it will simplify your data transfer as well.
