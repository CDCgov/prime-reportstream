# Guide to submitting data to ReportStream

## A step-by-step process for connecting your lab or facility to ReportStream

---

### Overview

Setting up an ELR connection to ReportStream will allow you to
automatically report disease data to the appropriate
jurisdiction(s) through an API. If you want to submit data
manually, then you'll need to
[create an account with SimpleReport](/resources/account-registration-guide)
instead.

Follow the steps outlined below to get started with an ELR
connection to ReportStream.

<ol className="usa-process-list">
  <li className="usa-process-list__item">
    <h3 className="usa-process-list__heading">
        Schedule kick-off:
    </h3>
    <p className="margin-top-05">
        Let us know you're interested by filling out and
        submitting <a href="https://app.smartsheetgov.com/b/form/8c71931f25e64e42bf1fef32900bdecd">this form</a>. We'll be in touch within a week to schedule a kick-off
        meeting and start the integration process, which
        officially begins once you create and email us a sample
        file with dummy test data (no PII).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li className="usa-process-list__item">
    <h3 className="usa-process-list__heading">
        Connect and test:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Once we've approved your data model (using your sample
        file) we'll onboard you to ReportStream's staging
        environment. You'll then be able to post test
        submissions (again, no PII) as well as test your code
        using ReportStream's staging API. We'll review your test
        data and help you correct any errors.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li className="usa-process-list__item">
    <h3 className="usa-process-list__heading">
        Launch and roll out:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Once all errors in data and/or code are addressed, we'll
        enable you in full production mode. Moving forward,
        you'll be submitting real data to the correct public
        health jurisdictions.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

### Reporting to public health entities

New testing facilities join ReportStream on a regular basis
through our partner SimpleReport or through other public health
data aggregators and apps. After they join, their data will be
sent automatically to the correct public health department(s) in
their jurisdiction who are part of ReportStream. Data is
accessible via our web application or the ELR connection.
