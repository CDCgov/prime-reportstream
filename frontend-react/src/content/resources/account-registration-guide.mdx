        <section className="margin-top-2">
            After opening the link in the activation email,
            follow the prompts to set up your account.

            **i. Create a secure password that includes:**

            - A minimum of 8 characters
            - An uppercase and a lowercase letter
            - A number

            **ii. Choose a "Forgot password" question**

            Use the drop-down list to select your preferred
            security question and enter your response.

            **iii. Set up multi-factor authentication**

            Pick a multi-factor authentication option, and click
            "Setup" below it. These authentication options are
            meant to secure your account. Below, you can review
            instructions for setting up
            [SMS authentication and Google Authenticator/Okta Verify](#set-up-multi-factor-authentication)
            .
            
            *If you choose biometric authentication, make
                sure that you'll only log in to ReportStream
                from the device you're currently using.
                Biometric authentication may be difficult to use
                across multiple devices.*

            **iv. Click "continue"**

            A prompt will appear confirming your account set-up
            is complete.

            Ignore the "continue to SimpleReport" button and
            simply close out of the window.

## Set up multi-factor authentication

If you choose SMS or Google Authenticator/Okta Verify as
your multi-factor authentication, follow the instructions
below to get set up.

### SMS authentication

<ProcessList>
    <ProcessListItem>
        Enter your phone number, then click
        **Send code**. (Make sure to click
        **Send code**, or you won't be able to
        continue.)
        ![Okta page asking for your phone number and the blue "Send code" button](/assets/img/getting-started/sms-step-1.png)
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        Check your text messages for a 6-digit authentication
        code.
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        Enter the code in the “Enter Code” field, then click **Verify**.
        ![Okta page with the "Enter Code" field and blue "Verify" button](/assets/img/getting-started/sms-step-3.png)
    </ProcessListItem>
</ProcessList>

#### Google Authenticator or Okta Verify
<ProcessList>
    <ProcessListItem>
        Select the kind of phone that you use (either iPhone or
        Android). You'll be asked to download an app. Download
        it on your phone and wait for it to install. (The page
        on your device might vary a bit from the screenshot
        below, based on your device type and whether you chose
        Google Authenticator or Okta Verify.)
        <br />
        ![Okta page that asks you to choose iPhone or Android, with directions for downloading the app](/assets/img/getting-started/authenticator-verify-step-1.png)
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        Once the app is installed, click **Next**.
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        Open the app and scan the QR code that appears on your
        ReportStream registration page. Once you've successfully
        scanned the QR code, click **Next**.
        ![Okta page with the QR code](/assets/img/getting-started/authenticator-verify-step-3.png)
    </ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListItem>
        Back on your phone, the app will show you a code. Enter
        the code on the registration page, then click{" "}
        **Verify**. (The code changes regularly, so
        you'll need to check the app each time you log in to
        ReportStream.)
        ![Okta page with the "Enter Code" field and blue "Verify" button](/assets/img/getting-started/authenticator-verify-step-4.png)
