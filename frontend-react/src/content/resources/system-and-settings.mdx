### Data security and storage

All ReportStream data is encrypted in transit and rest using
a TLS 1.2+ Azure standard. It is routed through a CDC cloud
environment, where it is deleted after 30 days. Additional
encryption can be provided if required by public health
departments.

As a project of the U.S. federal government, ReportStream
also complies with the{" "}
<A href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/fisma-background">Federal Information System Management Act</A>
{" "}(FISMA). FISMA sets standards and requires federal agencies
to implement information security plans to protect sensitive
data.

Get more information on{" "}
<A href="/resources/security-practices">ReportStream security practices</A>
.

### Data configuration and formatting

ReportStream submits data via HL7, version 2.5.1.

ReportStream data follows{" "}
<A href="https://www.hhs.gov/answers/is-additional-information-including-technical-specifications-available-to-support-laboratories-with-implementation/index.html">HHS guidance for COVID-19 Lab Data Reporting</A>
, including the recommended Health and Human Services
COVID-19 “Ask on Order Entry” questions. Sending Ask on
Order Entry questions (via{" "}
<A href="https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.5/Segments/OBX">OBX fields</A>
) is optional.

Public health departments can request data be sent via other
file formats such as CSV. Setting up alternative formats is
possible, but requires more time throughout the data
integration process.

### Data transport and sending

ReportStream uses a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
standard Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) connection.
Public health departments using the ReportStream ELR can
request data be sent in real time, or batched according to
your needs.

Public health departments can request alternative transport
platforms such as VPN, PHINMS, SOAP, etc. Setting up
alternative formats is possible, but requires more time
throughout the data integration process.

### File testing and launch

ReportStream can send a variety of data types to a public
health department test environment to make sure everything
is working correctly before launch.

- <b>Synthetic data (standard):</b>
{" "}ReportStream always sends synthetic data in our{" "}
<A href="https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/blob/production/prime-router/docs/schema_documentation/primedatainput-pdi-covid-19.md">standard data schema</A>
{" "}for your review.

- <b>Patient data (as needed):</b>
{" "}If required, ReportStream can also send patient data. In
some cases, there may not be a testing facility that is
registered with ReportStream in your jurisdiction. In
this case, we'll finish all of the possible steps on
your side. Once a testing facility registers we'll
notify you, then move to approval and launch.

### Approval and launch

For the first testing facility, we'll send patient data to
your test environment for approval before going live with
launch. After that, you'll get data automatically for any
new or existing testing facilities in your jurisdiction.

### Data access

Once state public health departments join ReportStream
you'll get data about all patients who are residents of that
state. You'll also get data from testing facilities
connected to ReportStream that are located in that state.

ReportStream can also send data to county, city, local,
territorial, and tribal public health departments, based on
state data access rules and regulations.
