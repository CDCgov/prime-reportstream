## Common errors
* **Two of the most important and often overlooked pieces of required data are the deviceIdentifier (OBX-17.1) and testPerformed (OBX-3.1).**
These fields must match exactly to the appropriate row in the LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) test code mapping.
[This is the most updated LIVD mapping](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/sars-cov-2-livd-codes.html) from the CDC. Specifics about each field are detailed in the tables below.
* **The preferred timestamp formatting for CSV and HL7 is yyyyMMddhhmmss+/-zzzz.**
If the UTC offset (+/-zzzz) is not present, results should be normalized to a single time zone that’s agreed upon during the onboarding process.
