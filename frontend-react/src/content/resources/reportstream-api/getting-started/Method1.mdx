**Step 1: Prior to submission, send your public key to ReportStream.**

<ol>
<li>
Prior to connecting to the endpoint, you’ll need a public/private keypair. There are many ways to do this. The steps below show how to create a key pair using `openssl`.

  EC
  ```
  openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp384r1 -noout -out my-es-keypair.pem
  openssl ec -in my-es-keypair.pem -pubout -out  my-es-public-key.pem
  ```
  RSA
  ```
openssl genrsa -out my-rsa-keypair.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in my-rsa-keypair.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out my-rsa-public-key.pem
  ```
</li>

<li>Send the public key to the ReportStream team using [our public key tool](/resources/manage-public-key).
Note: you’ll need to login to use that feature. If you do not have a login contact ReportStream support at [reportstream@cdc.gov](mailto:reportstream@cdc.gov). ReportStream will associate the key with your configuration within ReportStream.</li>
</ol>

You only need to do this step once, not every time you submit reports. If you need to change your keys at any time, contact ReportStream support.

**Step 2: At the time of submission, generate a signed JWT using your private key**

A JWT is a base64 encoded string that has three parts: `header`, `payload`, and `signature`.

You can find an example python program to generate a valid JWT [on GitHub](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/tree/master/prime-router/examples/generate-jwt-python/).

If you receive errors, reference [this list](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/tree/master/prime-router/examples/generate-jwt-python/jwt-errors.md) of error types for explanations and instructions.

Here is an example, using the fake `client-id healthy labs`, of header and payload data that should appear in a ReportStream JWT, prior to signature:

```
{
    "header": {
        "kid": "healthy-labs.default",
        "typ": "JWT",
        "alg": "RS256"
    },
    "payload": {
        "iss": "healthy-labs.default",
        "sub": "healthy-labs.default",
        "aud": "staging.prime.cdc.gov",
        "exp": 1660737164,
        "jti": "4b713fcd-2514-4207-b310-620b95b749c5"
    }
}
```
{
<Alert type="tip">
    <span className="text-bold">Note:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>The exp (expiration time) should be a Unix time, five minutes after the time the token was generated.</li>
        <li>The jti (JWT ID) should be a random unique string, new with every call.</li>
        <li>Generate the signed JWT using your private key.</li>
    </ul>
</Alert>
}

**Step 3: Send the signed JWT to ReportStream to get a temporary bearer token**

POST to the token URL, as in the example below, noting the following:
1. Use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
2. In the `scope` parameter, replace the dummy string `‘healthy-labs’` with your client-id, as assigned to you by ReportStream staff.
3. The `grant_type` and `client_assertion_type` parameters are always fixed values. The `grant_type` should be `client_credentials` and `client_assertion_type` should be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`, as in the example curl below.
4. In the client_assertion parameter, replace the \<token-signing-secret\> below with your JWT from above.
5. All the parameters are sent in the body/payload of the post (when using curl, via the `-d` option), not in the URL.
Here is an example ‘curl’ POST:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "scope=healthy-labs.default.report&grant_type=client_credentials
&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer&client_assertion=<token-signing-secret>" "https://staging.prime.cdc.gov/api/token"
```

You should get something like this back, which will be valid for five minutes:

```
{
    "access_token": "<long-access-token>",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 300,
    "expires_at_seconds": 1625260982,
    "scope": "healthy-labs.default.report"
}
```

**Step 4: Submit data to ReportStream using the bearer token**

Use the access token returned above as the bearer token for the submission:

CSV example

```
curl -H "authorization:bearer <long-bearer-token>" -H "client:healthy-labs"  -H "content-type:text/csv" --data-binary "@./healthy-labs-nonPII-data.csv" "https://staging.prime.cdc.gov/api/waters"
```

HL7 example

<pre>
<code>
curl -H "authorization:bearer \<long-bearer-token\>" -H "client:healthy-labs"  -H "content-type:application/hl7-v2"
--data-binary "@./<span className="text-primary-vivid">healthy-labs</span>-nonPII-data.hl7" {'"https://staging.prime.cdc.gov/api/waters"'}
</code>
</pre>

Again, always remember to replace the healthy-labs client-id with the client-id supplied to you by ReportStream staff.
