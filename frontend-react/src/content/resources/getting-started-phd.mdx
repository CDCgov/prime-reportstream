### Overview

An Electronic Lab Reporting (ELR) connection allows public
health authorities to automatically receive digital lab reports
from ReportStream via a secure server.

Connecting to ReportStream is similar to setting up an ELR feed
with a lab or hospital. There are just three steps:

<ol className="usa-process-list">
    <li className="usa-process-list__item">
        <h3 className="usa-process-list__heading">
            Schedule kick-off:
        </h3>
        <section className="margin-top-neg-1">
            Let us know you're interested by filling out and
            submitting{" "}
            <A href={site.forms.intakeElr.url}>this form</A>
            . We'll be in touch within a week to schedule a kick-off
            meeting and start the integration process.
        </section>
    </li>
    <li className="usa-process-list__item margin-top-neg-3">
        <h3 className="usa-process-list__heading">
            Connect and test:
        </h3>
        <section className="margin-top-neg-1">
            As part of kick-off, you'll share your SFTP server
            credentials. We'll then send test files and ensure the
            test data arrives correctly in your database.
        </section>
    </li>
    <li className="usa-process-list__item  margin-top-neg-3">
        <h3 className="usa-process-list__heading">
            Launch and roll out:
        </h3>
        <section className="margin-top-neg-1">
            We'll start sending you real data from testing
            facilities. As new data is sent in to ReportStream,
            we'll continually batch and send you only the data
            relevant to your jurisdiction.
        </section>
    </li>
</ol>

### Connecting to testing facilities

New testing facilities join ReportStream on a regular basis
through our partner SimpleReport or through other public health
data aggregators and apps. After they join, their data will be
sent automatically to the correct public health department(s) in
their jurisdiction who are part of ReportStream. Data is
accessible via the ReportStream website or the ELR connection.

website? Visit the ReportStream Data{" "}
