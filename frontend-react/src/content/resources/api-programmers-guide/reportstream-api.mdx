### About our API

**Waters API**

The Waters API — the primary secure entry point to ReportStream — is named in memory of Dr. Michael Stephan Waters (1973-2020). His tireless work at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration championed diagnostic data interoperability efforts nationwide. ReportStream honors Dr. Waters through continuation and elevation of his work.
