[Download Excel file (.xlsx)] Last updated: 1/6/23
Common errors
Two of the most important and often overlooked pieces of required data are the deviceIdentifier (OBX-17.1) and testPerformed (OBX-3.1). These fields must match exactly to the appropriate row in the LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) test code mapping. This is the most updated LIVD mapping from the CDC. Specifics about each field are detailed in the tables below.
The preferred timestamp formatting for CSV and HL7 is yyyyMMddhhmmss+/-zzzz. If the UTC offset (+/-zzzz) is not present, results should be normalized to a single time zone that’s agreed upon during the onboarding process.

Legend

Yes: Required field for acceptance
Yes – Conditional: Required, but only under certain circumstances. Review the field’s Data Requirements and Additional Guidance for more information.
Requested: Field should be populated if available. In addition, some states may treat this as a required field.

Note about OTC reporting:

For CSV implementations, include only the columns marked with “(OTC)” in the CSV Column Names below.
For HL7 implementations, do not use this table. Refer to the RADx MARS Getting started guide.
