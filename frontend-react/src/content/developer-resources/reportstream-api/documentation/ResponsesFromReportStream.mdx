## Response messages

**Asynchronous processing**

ReportStream uses asynchronous (async) processing. Upon submitting data via ReportStream async processing, 
the REST endpoint returns almost immediately. However, ReportStream doesn't return information about where the tests will be sent. 

In exchange for speed, the async submission response provides less initial information in the JSON. 
The initial response will provide errors and warnings, but no destination or filter information. 
The History Details API can be queried later to get full information about expected and actual destinations.

Example ReportStream response to an async submission:

<CodeSnippet>
{`{
   "submissionId":1604,
   "timestamp":"2022-02-10T13:50:19.162694Z",
   "sender":"simple_report.default",
   "httpStatus":201,
   "id":"3597ad7d-b92c-4bc0-a8fc-d909ed87bc90",
   "reportItemCount":2,
   "destinationCount":0,
   "destinations": [],
   "errors": [],
   "warnings": [],
   "topic":"covid-19",
   "warningCount":0,
   "errorCount":0
}`}
</CodeSnippet>

ReportStream features a History Details API that can be later queried to obtain the actual destinations and relevant detail using your existing private/public key pair.

The request can be made by using either the submissionId or id returned in the API response. Using the earlier example:

Using SubmissionID:

<CodeSnippet>
https://prime.cdc.gov/api/waters/report/1588/history 
</CodeSnippet>

Using ID:

<CodeSnippet>
https://prime.cdc.gov/api/waters/report/3597ad7d-b92c-4bc0-a8fc-d909ed87bc90/history 
</CodeSnippet>

The sentReports sections contain details about where and when the reports were transmitted.

Additionally, you can retrieve the complete list of submissions made to ReportStream by calling this API: 

<CodeSnippet>
https://prime.cdc.gov/api/waters/org/simple_report.default/submissions  
</CodeSnippet>

Response:

<CodeSnippet>
{`[
  {
    "submissionId": 158,
    "timestamp": "2024-11-19T22:47:23.852Z",
    "sender": "simple_report.default",
    "httpStatus": 201,
    "id": "8e33a43c-7513-4973-ac9f-5bd4e1cfcadb",
    "topic": "full-elr",
    "reportItemCount": 1,
    "fileName": "ignore.ignore-full-elr-e2e%2F8e33a43c-7513-4973-ac9f-5bd4e1cfcadb.hl7",
    "fileType": "HL7"
  },
  {
    "submissionId": 154,
    "timestamp": "2024-11-19T22:43:59.600Z",
    "sender": "simple_report.default",

  }
]`}
</CodeSnippet>

## JSON error responses

In error cases, no report "id" UUID is returned, because no report was created based on the submission.

Example failure response and identical HistoryAPI response (Note the "id" is null, and the “httpStatus” is not 201):

<CodeSnippet>
{`{
    "submissionId": 1594,
    "timestamp": "2022-02-09T20:44:55.055545Z",
    "sender": "simple_report",
    "destinationCount" : 0,
    "httpStatus": 400,
    "id": null,
    "destinations": [],
    "errors": [
        {
            "scope": "item",
            "index": 1,
            "trackingId": "abcde",
            "type": "error",
            "message": "Blank value for element 'Patient_last_name' ('patient_last_name')"
        }
    ],
    "warnings": [],
    "topic": null,
    "warningCount": 0,
    "errorCount": 1
}`}
</CodeSnippet>

Example of a report level error:

<CodeSnippet>
{`{
    "submissionId": 1599,
    "timestamp": "2022-02-09T20:56:16.82117Z",
    "sender": "strac",
    "httpStatus": 400,
    "id": null,
    "destinationCount" : 0,
    "destinations": [],
    "errors": [
        {
            "scope": "report",
            "index": null,
            "trackingId": null,
            "type": "error",
            "message": "CSV file has an inconsistent number of columns on row: 3"
        }
    ],
    "warnings": [],
    "topic": null,
    "warningCount": 0,
    "errorCount": 1
}`}
</CodeSnippet>
