## Response messages

**Asynchronous processing**

ReportStream uses asynchronous (async) processing. Upon submitting data via ReportStream async processing, 
the REST endpoint returns almost immediately. However, ReportStream doesn't return information about where the tests will be sent. 

In exchange for speed, the async submission response provides less initial information in the JSON. 
The initial response will provide errors and warnings, but no destination or filter information. 
The History Details API can be queried later to get full information about expected and actual destinations.

Example ReportStream response to an async submission:

```
{
   "submissionId":1604,
   "timestamp":"2022-02-10T13:50:19.162694Z",
   "sender":"simple_report.default",
   "httpStatus":201,
   "id":"3597ad7d-b92c-4bc0-a8fc-d909ed87bc90",
   "reportItemCount":2,
   "destinationCount":0,
   "destinations": [],
   "errors": [],
   "warnings": [],
   "topic":"covid-19",
   "warningCount":0,
   "errorCount":0
}
```

ReportStream features a History Details API that can be later queried to obtain the actual destinations and relevant detail. 
If you’d like to use this API, let the ReportStream team know, and we’ll provide you with additional information about requirements 
for Okta authentication.

The request is made with the submissionId in the earlier example.:

```
https://prime.cdc.gov/api/history/simple_report/submissions/1588
```

Response:

```

    "submissionId": 1588,

        {
            "organization_id": "de-dph",
            "service": "elr",
            "filteredReportRows": [],
            "sending_at": "2022-02-09T17:00:00.000000Z",
            "itemCount": 1,
            "sentReports": [

                    "itemCount": 1
                }
            ],
            "organization": "Delaware Division of Public Health"

    ],
    "errors": [],
    "warnings": [],
    "topic": "covid-19",
    "warningCount": 0,
    "errorCount": 0
}
```

The sentReports sections contain details about where and when the reports were transmitted.

## JSON error responses

In error cases, no report "id" UUID is returned, because no report was created based on the submission.

Example failure response and identical HistoryAPI response (Note the "id" is null, and the “httpStatus” is not 201):

```
{
    "submissionId": 1594,
    "timestamp": "2022-02-09T20:44:55.055545Z",
    "sender": "simple_report",
    "destinationCount" : 0,
    "httpStatus": 400,
    "id": null,
    "destinations": [],
    "errors": [
        {
            "scope": "item",
            "index": 1,
            "trackingId": "abcde",
            "type": "error",
            "message": "Blank value for element 'Patient_last_name' ('patient_last_name')"
        }
    ],
    "warnings": [],
    "topic": null,
    "warningCount": 0,
    "errorCount": 1
}
```

Example of a report level error:

```
{
    "submissionId": 1599,
    "timestamp": "2022-02-09T20:56:16.82117Z",
    "sender": "strac",
    "httpStatus": 400,
    "id": null,
    "destinationCount" : 0,
    "destinations": [],
    "errors": [
        {
            "scope": "report",
            "index": null,
            "trackingId": null,
            "type": "error",
            "message": "CSV file has an inconsistent number of columns on row: 3"
        }
    ],
    "warnings": [],
    "topic": null,
    "warningCount": 0,
    "errorCount": 1
}
```
