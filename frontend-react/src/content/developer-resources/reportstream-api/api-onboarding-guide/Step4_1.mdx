Prior to connecting to the endpoint, you’ll need a public/private keypair. There are many ways to do this. The steps below show how to create a key pair using `openssl`.

  EC
<CodeSnippet>
  openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp384r1 -noout -out my-es-keypair.pem
  openssl ec -in my-es-keypair.pem -pubout -out  my-es-public-key.pem
</CodeSnippet>

  RSA
<CodeSnippet>
    openssl genrsa -out my-rsa-keypair.pem 2048
    openssl rsa -in my-rsa-keypair.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out my-rsa-public-key.pem
</CodeSnippet>

</li>

<li>Send the public key to the ReportStream team using [our public key tool](/manage-public-key).
Note: you’ll need to login to use that feature. If you do not have a login contact ReportStream support at [reportstream@cdc.gov](mailto:reportstream@cdc.gov). ReportStream will associate the key with your configuration within ReportStream.</li>
</ol>

You only need to do this step once, not every time you submit reports. If you need to change your keys at any time, contact ReportStream support.
