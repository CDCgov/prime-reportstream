After completing the mapping file, export the column headers and filled rows as a CSV file. Upload that generated CSV to our [code mapping tool <Icon name='Lock' className="text-ttop text-primary" />](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/onboarding/code-mapping) and correct any errors. Once the errors are corrected, download any remaining unmapped codes as a CSV and send the file
to your onboarding engineer or [reportstream@cdc.gov](mailto:reportstream@cdc.gov). We will review your codes and provide next steps to continue your onboarding.
