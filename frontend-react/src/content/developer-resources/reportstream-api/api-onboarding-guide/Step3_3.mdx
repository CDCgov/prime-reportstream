Input all codes for organisms that your organization will send through ReportStream. If you are not sending any reportable microbiological culture results, you can move on to Step 2.4.    

In column A (**Code**): Enter the coded value for all potential reportable organisms. This should be the value sent in `OBX-5.1` in an HL7 Message or `Bundle.entry.resource.ofType(Observation).value CodableConcept.cod` of a FHIR Observation resource.   

In column B (**Name**): Enter the textual description of the code in column A. If the value in column A is a SNOMED code, use the SNOMED description. If the value in column A is a local code, use a descriptive result name. 

In column C (**Coding system**):  Enter `SNOMEDCT` if the value in column A is a SNOMED code. Enter `LOCAL` if the value is a local code.
