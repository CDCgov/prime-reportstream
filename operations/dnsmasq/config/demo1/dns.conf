# Set logging facility
# If there is at least one / in the log-facility, it will be treated
# as a file. dnsmasq will close and reopen the file when it receives
# signal USR2, which allows for log rotation without stopping dnsmasq.
# You'll want to set a bind mount to access this file on your local host
# and manage it's logs using logrotate.
#log-facility=/var/log/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.log

# Turn on query logging. Be warned, this can eat up disk space
# quickly.
