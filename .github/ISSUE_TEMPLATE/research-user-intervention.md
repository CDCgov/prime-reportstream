## Overview

**If pre-intervention:** Assess current status of new partner before they start using ReportStream. We need to understand their needs and our potential impact.  

**If interim-intervention:** Assess how the intervention is going so we can provide support and collect data about pain points. An opportunity to show mockups or prototypes and get their feedback.  

**If post-intervention:** Assess impact of the intervention by asking similar questions to baseline.
