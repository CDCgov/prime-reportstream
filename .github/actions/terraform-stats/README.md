## Synopsis

Output the following statistics for the Terraform environment:
1. Terraform version
2. Drift count
   * "Drift" refers to changes made outside of Terraform and does not necessary match any resources listed for changes.
3. Resource drifts
4. Change count
   * "Change" refers to change actions that Terraform plans to use to move from the prior state to a new state.
5. Change percent
   * Percentage of changes to total resources.
6. Resource changes
