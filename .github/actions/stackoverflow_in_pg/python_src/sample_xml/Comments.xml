Incidentally, I would have marked an accepted answer based on the answers available at the time. Also, accepted doesn't mean Best :)" CreationDate="2008-09-06T08:42:16.980" UserId="380" />

  <row Id="15" PostId="47373" Score="0" Text="Just wanted to mention that this is an excellent solution if you consider the problem to be linear (i.e. treating `A1B2` as a single number). I still think the problem is multi-dimensional, but I guess we'll just have to wait for the author to clarify :)" CreationDate="2008-09-06T14:30:40.217" UserId="2495" />
