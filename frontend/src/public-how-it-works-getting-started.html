  <p class="usa-intro">First, we’ll get you connected to our web application, where you can immediately start downloading reporting data that is relevant to your jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class="usa-intro">Depending on your needs, we can also create a customized Electronic Lab Reporting (ELR) connection —  an online setup used to send digital lab reports to public health departments via a secure server. Either way, reach out to us and we’ll get back to you in about a week.</p>

  ## <a name="data-download"></a>Data download

  Our fastest option to get up and running, our web application gives you access to reporting results via manual download from our online portal, in just two steps.

  <ol class="usa-process-list">
    <li class="usa-process-list__item">
      <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Kickoff and onboarding</h4>
      <p class="margin-top-05"><a href="mailto:{{ site.orgs.RS.email }}{{ mailtoSubject }}" class="usa-link">Send us an email</a> with the information below. In most cases we’ll review and approve your account in about a week.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name of public health department</li>
        <li>Jurisdiction type (state, county, city, etc.)</li>
        <li>Name of jurisdiction (For example: “Harris County” or “Washington State”)</li>
        <li>Name(s) and email(s) of people who need database access</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="usa-process-list__item">
      <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Log in</h4>
      <p>We’ll send you your account information, then simply log in to download your reporting data.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

## <a name="elr-connection"></a>ELR connection

If you’ve decided you’ll need an ELR connection for your public health data reporting, we’ll get some information from you on your needs and requirements. Connecting with ReportStream is similar to setting up an ELR feed with a lab or hospital, and takes just a few steps.

<ol class="usa-process-list">
  <li class="usa-process-list__item">
    <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Kickoff and onboarding</h4>
    <p class="margin-top-05">Tell us your data configuration requirements and preferences by submitting our <a href="{{ site.forms.intakeElr.url}}" class="usa-link">ReportStream ELR onboarding form</a>.  We’ll review your requirements and reach out to start the data integration process in about a week.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="usa-process-list__item">
    <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Connect and test</h4>
    <p>After sharing credentials for your SFTP server, we’ll work with you to ensure testing facility data arrives correctly in your database. First we’ll send over some test files and after the files are accepted by both ReportStream and the public health department, we’re ready for production, launch, and roll out.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="usa-process-list__item">
    <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Launch and roll out</h4>
    <p>Together we’ll decide on the first testing facility to begin sending you data. Going forward, it’s easy to register new testing facilities as they join ReportStream.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

## <a name="connecting-to-testing-facilities"></a>Connecting to testing facilities

New testing facilities join ReportStream on a regular basis, through our partner SimpleReport, or through other public health data aggregators and apps. After they join, their data will be sent automatically to the correct public health department(s) in their jurisdiction who are part of ReportStream. Data is accessible via our web application or the ELR connection.

You can request a weekly email update from ReportStream to notify you when new facilities join in your jurisdiction, and let us know if you have any special requirements for them to complete before they join.
