  ## <a name="data-security-and-storage"></a>Data security and storage 

  All ReportStream data is encrypted in transit and rest using a TLS 1.2+ Azure standard. It is routed through a CDC cloud environment, where it is deleted after 30 days. Additional encryption can be provided if required by public health departments. 

  As a project of  of the U.S. federal government, ReportStream also complies with the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/fisma-background" class="usa-link">Federal Information System Management Act</a> (FISMA). FISMA sets standards and requires federal agencies to implement information security plans to protect sensitive data.   

  Get more information on <a href="/how-it-works/security-practices" class="usa-link">ReportStream security practices</a>. 

  ## <a name="data-configuration-and-formatting"></a>Data configuration and formatting 
  
  ReportStream submits data via HL7, version 2.5.1.  

  ReportStream data follows <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/answers/is-additional-information-including-technical-specifications-available-to-support-laboratories-with-implementation/index.html" class="usa-link">HHS guidance for COVID-19 Lab Data Reporting</a>, including the recommended Health and Human Services COVID-19 “Ask on Order Entry” questions. Sending Ask on Order Entry questions (via <a href="https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.5/Segments/OBX" class="usa-link">OBX fields</a>) is optional. 

  Public health departments can request data be sent via other file formats such as CSV. Setting up alternative formats is possible, but requires more time throughout the data integration process. 

  ## <a name="data-transport-and-sending"></a>Data transport and sending 

  ReportStream uses a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) standard ELR connection. Public health departments using the ReportStream ELR can request data be sent in real time, or batched according to your needs.  

  Public health departments can request alternative transport platforms such as VPN, PNIMS, SOAP, etc. Setting up alternative formats is possible, but requires more time throughout the data integration process. 

  ## <a name="file-testing-and-launch"></a>File testing and launch  

  ReportStream can send a variety of data types to a public health department test environment to make sure everything is working correctly before launch. 

  - **Synthetic data (standard):** ReportStream always sends synthetic data in our <a href="https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-data-hub/blob/production/prime-router/docs/schema_documentation/primedatainput-pdi-covid-19.md&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619546431803000&usg=AOvVaw1E09LDMJ0kGE2qa_OPZojW" class="usa-link">standard data schema</a> for your review. 
  - **Patient data (as needed):** If required, ReportStream can also send patient data. In some cases, there may not be a testing facility that is registered with ReportStream in your jurisdiction. In this case, we’ll finish all of the possible steps on your side. Once a testing facility registers we’ll notify you, then move to approval and launch. 

  ### Approval and launch 

  For the first testing facility, we’ll send patient data to your test environment for approval before going live with launch. After that, you’ll get data automatically for any new or existing testing facilities in your jurisdiction.  

  ## <a name="data-access"></a>Data access 

  Once state public health departments join ReportStream you’ll get data about all patients who are residents of that state. You’ll also get data from testing facilities connected to ReportStream that are located in that state. 

  ReportStream can also send data to county, city, local, territorial, and tribal public health departments, based on state data access rules and regulations.
