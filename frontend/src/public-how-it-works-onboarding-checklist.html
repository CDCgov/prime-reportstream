  ### <a name="data-requirements-and-preferences"></a>Data requirements and preferences 

  ReportStream sends data as an [HL7](http://why.hl7.org/) file via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). We capture Health and Human Services (HHS) required fields, including “Ask on Order Entry” questions.  

  Please note: ReportStream follows industry standards for [data formatting](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-data-hub/blob/production/prime-router/docs/schema_documentation/primedatainput-pdi-covid-19.md) and reporting. While we can support custom format or sending mechanisms, this will increase the time required to build your connection. 

  Confirm your preferences and provide details for:  

  - **File type:** (HL7 v2.5.1, CSV, or other) 
  - **Transport method:** (SFTP, VPN, Health Information Exchange, SOAP, PHINMS, or other) 
  - **Batching:** Do you want HL7 message batching (using [FHS and BHS segments](https://www.lyniate.com/knowledge-hub/hl7-batch-file-protocol/))? 
  - **Timing:** Do you want real time or daily reports, and at what time of day? 
  - **“Ask on Order Entry”:** Do you want “Ask on Order Entry” questions as [OBX fields](https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.5/Segments/OBX)? 
  - **Test data:** Do you require synthetic and/or real patient data before going live? 
  - **Local public health department reporting:** Explain any local public health department reporting requirements that are different from the state. 
  - **Third-party information services:** Do you require your data to be routed through a third-party like a Health Information Exchange or a health information integration service? 
  - **Additional fields:** Any other data or fields you’d like collected? 

  ### T<a name="testing-facility-registration"></a>esting facility registration 

  ReportStream collects unique identifiers from testing facilities when they register to send data, including name, [CLIA](https://www.cdc.gov/clia/about.html) number, and address. This information is included with data sent to public health departments.   

  - **Registration requirements:** Do you require testing facilities to register before data is sent to you? 
  - **Custom data fields:** Do you require information in addition to standard fields (name, CLIA number and/or address)? 
  - **Custom registration process:** Do you have a custom testing facility registration process? 

  ### <a name="hl7-data-fields"></a>HL7 data fields (Not applicable if using an alternate data format) 

  - Receiving application name 
  - Receiving application [OID](https://www.hl7.org/oid/) 
  - Receiving facility name 
  - Receiving facility [OID](https://www.hl7.org/oid/) 

  ### <a name="sftp-details"></a>SFTP details
