# Security Policy

This document outlines our security policy for the code base and product and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability or security-related issue, _please report them to us directly_.

**Do not create GitHub issues for security issues.** Please report any security related issues you find to **_TBD_** or ask us to reach out to you directly.

When informing us of security issues, please use a descriptive subject line for your report. In addition, please include the following information along with your report:

- Your name and affiliation (if any).
- A description of the technical details of the vulnerabilities. This will help us in reliably reproducing your finding(s).
- An explanation who can exploit this vulnerability, and what they gain when doing so -- write an attack scenario. This will help us evaluate your report quickly, especially if the issue is complex.
- Whether this vulnerability public or known to third parties. If it is, please provide details.

If you believe that an existing (public) issue is security-related, please send an email to **_TBD_**. Your report should include the issue ID (and/or link) and a short description of why it should be handled according to this security policy.
