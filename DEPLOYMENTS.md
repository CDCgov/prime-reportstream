## When do ReportStream deployments take place?

ReportStream production deployments take place on Tuesdays and Thursday around 10am EST.

The testing and staging environments are automatically deployed on every merge into `master` through our Continuous Deployment pipeline.

## How is ReportStream deployed?

We automatically deploy changes through [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/release.yml) based on changes in target branches as described in the table below. These changes can only enter these branches through successfully reviewed Pull Requests.

| Changes are merged into branch | Changes get deployed into environment(s) | Release Builds |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `master` | test and staging | [pre-release](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases/tag/v-pre-release) (staging) |
| `production` | production | [release](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/releases/latest) |

The deployment process is zero-downtime with a blue/green deployment process used [via Azure Function deployment slots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-slots). The deployment process is [documented in PR #1318](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/issues/1318).

Our CI/CD pipeline does not run the Smoke Tests; therefor you *must* run the Smoke tests manually after every deployment. While this will change in the near future (i.e. in the future, they _will_ be included in the pipeline), until that time, *you must run the Smoke tests manually and validate they complete successfully* before directing _any_ traffic to the newly deployed code.
You can track [#656](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/issues/656) for the status on running the Smoke tests automatically.

## What is deployed?

The GitHub Action deploys changes in the following directories:

| Directory | Deployment Process |
|:--|:--|
| [/prime-router](/prime-router) | New version released to Azure Functions |
| [/frontend](/frontend) | Static site served via an Azure Storage Account |
| [/operations](/operations) | Not deployed. (Coming soon in, see #578) |

## What is our deployment process for production?

In preparation for our Tuesday and Thursday deployments, a cutoff time has been established.

| Deployment Window | Cutoff Time |
|:--|:--|
| Tuesday, 10am EST | Monday, 12pm EST |
| Thursday, 10am EST | Wednesday, 12pm EST |

The cutoff time is automatically enforced via automatic branching from `master` into a dedicated deployment branch targeting the `production` branch through a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/prepare_deployment_branch.yaml).

1. At the specified cut-off time (Mondays and Wednesdays at noon ET), the GitHub action creates a new branch named `deployment/YYYY-MM-DD` (where the YYYY-MM-DD is `today + 1day`, i.e. the date of the deployment, not the date of the branching) which branches from `master`. This branch now contains everything that was present in `master` at that cut-off time. This is the content that is/will be part of the production deployment.
1. A new PR from the deployment branch is filed to merge `deployment/YYYY-MM-DD` into `production`. The PR has title `"Deployment of YYYY-MM-DD"` and is tagged with the [`deployment` tag](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/issues?q=label%3Adeployment).
1. The contents of `master` is deployed to the staging environment for verification
    * Manual testing takes place
1. The PR is reviewed by the team
1. The PR is merged during the specified deployment window by an approved team member.
    * **Note:** Special care must be taken if the release includes schema changes that add or remove data elements for receivers whose data is waiting for the `batch` step at the time of deployment.
    * Inconsistencies between data models and actual internal data can cause errors.
    * At this time, our solution has been to do the deployments at times when there is no work-in-progress (WIP) in the system.
1. The GitHub Action deploys the PR to the production environment
1. A smoke test is run against production

## Reduce duplication in GitHub Actions

Steps duplicated across multiple GitHub workflows are not only difficult to maintain, but they also present a security risk when some steps are not implemented in a particular manner.

Risk example:

 1. The action to fetch a secret from Azure Key Vault will leak values to the GitHub Actions log if any method other than the [env context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#env-context) is used to assign to a variable.
 
    A local action can be shared that already mitigates this risk.

For sets of actions *(e.g. VPN, Azure login, build, etc.)* that are shared across multiple workflows, [local composite actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#composite-actions) allow them to reside in a [**single** location](.github/actions). 

Branch restrictions *(`if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/production'`)* can also be included in the local action to prevent unintended activity.
