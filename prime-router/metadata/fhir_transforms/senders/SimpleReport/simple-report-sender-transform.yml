  #       doing this in the UP until we start routing the Covid results through the UP to keep dates consistent across.

  #  The received date time for the specimen. This field is very important to many states for their HL7,
  #  but for most of our senders, the received date time is the same as the collected date time. Unfortunately,
  #  setting them to the same time breaks many validation rules. Most ELR systems apparently look for them to
  #  be offset, so this field takes the `specimen_collection_date_time` field and offsets it by a small amount.
  # TODO: Move this to default sender transform once simple report starts sending us covid through the UP
  #       THE Covid pipeline adds 6 seconds to received date time to avoid having the same date for
  #       both collected and received.
  #       Right now we can't subtract the 15 minutes SR subtracts from dates in the covid pipeline and add the 6 seconds
  #       the Covid Pipeline adds. So we have to do it all at once by subtracting 894 seconds. Adding the 6
  #       should be part of the default sender transforms.
