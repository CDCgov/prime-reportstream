  # OBX-2 - To populate this field with CWE, an Observation needs to have one of these values set:
  #         Observation.coding[0].version, Observation.coding[1].version, or Observation.text
  #         However, SimpleReport is not sending us any of those values and NY expects this to be CWE

  # However, SimpleReport sends AOE questions under ServiceRequest.supportInfo and we need to suppress those
