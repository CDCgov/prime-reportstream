 *
 * Format: HH[MM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]
 * In prior versions of HL7, this data type was always specified to be in the
 * format HHMM[SS[.SSSS]][+/-ZZZZ] using a 24 hour clock notation. In the
 * current and future versions, the precision of a time may be expressed by
 * limiting the number of digits used with the format specification as shown
 * above. By site-specific agreement, HHMM[SS[.SSSS]][+/-ZZZZ] may be used where
 * backward compatibility must be maintained.
 * Thus, HH is used to specify a precision of "hour," HHMM is used to specify a
 * precision of "minute," HHMMSS is used to specify a precision of seconds, and
 * HHMMSS.SSSS is used to specify a precision of ten-thousandths of a second.
 * In each of these cases, the time zone is an optional component. The fractional
 * seconds could be sent by a transmitter who requires greater precision than whole
 * seconds. Fractional representations of minutes, hours or other higher-order units
 * of time are not permitted.
 * Note: The time zone [+/-ZZZZ], when used, is restricted to legally-defined time zones
 * and is represented in HHMM format.
 * The time zone of the sender may be sent optionally as an offset from the coordinated
 * universal time (previously known as Greenwich Mean Time). Where the time zone
 * is not present in a particular TM field but is included as part of the date/time
 * field in the MSH segment, the MSH value will be used as the default time zone.
 * Otherwise, the time is understood to refer to the local time of the sender.
 * Midnight is represented as 0000.
 * Examples:|235959+1100| 1 second before midnight in a time zone eleven hours
 * ahead of Universal Coordinated Time (i.e., east of Greenwich).
 * |0800| Eight AM, local time of the sender.
 * |093544.2312| 44.2312 seconds after Nine thirty-five AM, local time of sender.
 * |13| 1pm (with a precision of hours), local time of sender.
