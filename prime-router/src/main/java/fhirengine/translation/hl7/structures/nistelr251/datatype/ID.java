 *
 * The value of such a field follows the formatting rules for an ST field except
 * that it is drawn from a table of legal values. There shall be an HL7 table number
 * associated with ID data types. An example of an ID field is OBR-25-result status.
 * This data type should be used only for HL7 tables (see Section 2.7.6, "Table").
 * The reverse is not true, since in some circumstances it is more appropriate to use
 * the CE data type for HL7 tables.
 *
 * Note: validation of the input string value will only be initiated if the
 * corresponding HL7 tableid has been set.  Basically if the object is created
 * without a tableid and the table id is not subsequently set, then the input string value
 * will be subjected to a length check (<= 200 chars) and then stored into the object.
