 * Format: YYYY[MM[DD]]
 * In prior versions of HL7, this data type was always specified to be in the format YYYYMMDD. In the current and future
 * versions, the precision of a date may be expressed by limiting the number of digits used with the format specification
 * YYYY[MM[DD]]. Thus, YYYY is used to specify a precision of "year," YYYYMM specifies a precision of "month,"
 * and YYYYMMDD specifies a precision of "day."
 * By site-specific agreement, YYYYMMDD may be used where backward compatibility must be maintained.
 * Examples:   |19880704|  |199503|
