However, one may either still want to use MSH-3 in total or a combination of content from MSH-3 and MSH-24.  That is a local implementation decision to adjust the mapping accordingly.

Example: MSH|^~\%|LAB|…

If both MSH-3 and MSH-24 are not valued, which is valid, then the implementer needs to resolve whether to assign this a known value since they know the context, or add the data absent reason extension to provide a reason and satisfies the mandatory FHIR attribute rules.  Note that the use of the data-absent-reason extension may result  in a FHIR resource that is not usable by the recipient."

Until then we encourage implementers to share feedback on how they are planning to address this that we can consider for inclusion"
