**What is Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a segment of the application security testing (AST) tool market that deals with managing open source component use.
SCA tools perform automated scans of an application’s code base, including related artifacts such as containers and registries, to identify all open source components, their license compliance data, and any security vulnerabilities. In addition to providing visibility into open source use, some SCA tools also help fix open source vulnerabilities through prioritization and auto remediation.

**Why (SCA Should Be Part of Your Application Security Portfolio)**
Open source components have become the main building block in software applications across all verticals. Yet despite the heavy reliance on open source, too many organizations are lax about ensuring that their open source components meet basic security standards and are compliant with licensing requirements.
Securing your application in today’s complex digital world is a challenge. With the right Software Composition Analysis solution, you’re one step closer to mitigating your open source risk.

**Benefits**
SCA’s value is the security, speed, and reliability it offers. Manual tracking of open source code is no longer sufficient; it simply can’t keep up with the sheer amount of open source. And the increasing prevalence of cloud-native applications and more-complex applications make robust and dependable SCA tools a necessity.

**Identify Vulnerabilities in Open Source**
•	Scan open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
•	Get data-driven recommendations for version updating with details on the fix impact to your code before automating the change.
•	Gain comprehensive, centralized visibility across different environments and applications, and detect flaws earlier.

**Dependabot – Githubs version of SCA**
Keeping your dependencies updated is one of the easiest ways to keep the software you build secure. However, while it’s critically important to keep your dependencies updated, in a recent survey, 52% of developers said they find it painful1. Dependabot alleviates that pain by updating your dependencies automatically, so you can spend less time updating dependencies and more time building. Up until now, the Dependabot features we’ve brought to GitHub have focused on automated security updates, which update packages that have known vulnerabilities.
&nbsp;  
 GitHub watches the National Vulnerability Database and other sources for vulnerabilities in open-source packages. If Dependabot finds a vulnerability in a package you depend on, it sends you an alert. If it can suggest a fix, it also sends a pull request to update your dependency manifest with the closest non-vulnerable version.
