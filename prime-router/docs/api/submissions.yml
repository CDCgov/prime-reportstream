          description: The cursor pointing to the next portion of results. If you don't pass a `cursor` parameter, but **do** pass a `limit` parameter, the default value retrieves the first portion of results. Paginated responses include a `response_metadata` object that includes a `next_cursor` *when there are additional results to be retrieved.* On your next call to the same method, set the `cursor` parameter equal to the `next_cursor` value you received on the last request to retrieve the next portion of the collection. An empty, null, or non-existent `next_cursor` in the response indicates no further results.
