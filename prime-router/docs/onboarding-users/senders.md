## Rhapsody Configuration

Rhapsody is a health data pipeline that provides a visual interface representing various flows of health data. It uses
`Communication Points` of various types to interface with external systems.

### Using x-functions-key

The `HTTP Communications Point` uses a standard HTTP request to send data externally. It has been used in conjunction
with the `x-functions-key` authentication flow to connect clients in the `staging` environment. However, this auth flow is
deprecated and should not be used to onboard any new clients moving forward (documentation kept for posterity).

It is recommended to use oauth2 or server-to-server auth instead. The observed versions of Rhapsody cannot support the
OAuth2 authentication flow (javascript version too old).
