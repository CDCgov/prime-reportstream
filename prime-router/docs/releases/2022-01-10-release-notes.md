## For this release

### Addition of warnings and errors when submitting invalid test devices

When uploading to the ReportStream REST endpoint, a warning is returned if the test device information
provided in a report cannot be validated against the list provided by the 
[Department of Health and Human Servicesâ€™ (HHS) LOINC Mapping spreadsheet](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/sars-cov-2-livd-codes.html).
If a given field with the test device information is required and cannot be validated then an error is returned instead and the 
report is rejected.
