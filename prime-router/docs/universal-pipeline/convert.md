# Universal Pipeline Convert Step
The convert step is executed when the [Azure AQS message](README.md#aqs-usage) referencing a received [Report](README.md#report-and-item), created by the [Receive](receive.md) step, is scheduled by Azure. For each [Item](README.md#report-and-item) contained in the received Report, the convert step will:

  1. Transform the item to the FHIR format
  2. Apply the configured [sender transform](#sender-transforms), if one is configured
  3. Generate a new Report
  4. Schedule the Route step for the new Report

## Conversion
The first and most significant aspect of the convert step is the conversion of a message into the FHIR format. The 
process of this conversion depends on the incoming message's format:

- If the incoming message is HL7v2, ReportStream uses the [LinuxForHealth HL7 to FHIR Converter library](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/hl7v2-fhir-converter#linuxforhealth-hl7-to-fhir-converter) with custom configurations from the 
- [fhir_mapping folder](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/tree/master/prime-router/metadata/fhir_mapping/hl7) 
-to handle the conversion. See the 
- [HL7v2-to-FHIR configurations](../design/design/transformations.md#HL7v2-to-FHIR-configurations) section for more 
- details.
- If the incoming message is FHIR, then there's nothing to be done
- Apply Sender transforms specified by Sender configuration

> Currently, no other input formats besides HL7v2 and FHIR are supported in the Universal Pipeline. In order to support 
> new formats, they would need to be transformed to FHIR by some new method.

## Sender Transforms
After the conversion of an Item to the FHIR format, an additional transform can run on the resulting FHIR bundle. This 
transform is called a "Sender Transform" because it is used to make sender-specific adjustments to the FHIR bundle.

Sender Transforms are completely optional, but ReportStream has created a sender transform that mimics the behavior of 
original pipeline (`prime-router/metadata/fhir_transforms/senders/original-pipeline-transforms.yml`). This is a good place 
to start to understand what kind of transforms a Sender may want performed on their messages.

## Retries

There is no custom retry strategy for this step.  If an error occurs during this step, the message is re-queued up to 
five
times before being placed in the poison queue.
