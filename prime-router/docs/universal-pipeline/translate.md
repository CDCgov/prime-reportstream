# Universal Pipeline Translate Step

After the [route step](route.md) has determined the receivers for a message, the translate step will determine based on
each receiverâ€™s translation settings what format the message should be sent in. If the receiver wants HL7v2, the UP can
translate the message using the default receiver transforms or use a custom receiver transform. If the receiver wants
FHIR, since the message at this point is already in the FHIR format, we can either send it to them as it is, or we can
optionally apply a `FhirTransformer`, similarly to what is used for sender-specific changes in
the [convert step](convert.md), but this time as a receiver transform.

## Configuration

The configuration for this step is done on an individual receiver level and there are a variety of settings that can be
applied to change the resulting output report that is passed along to the batch step

### Receiver Settings

- `format`: what format the receiver wants, either HL7 or FHIR
- `schemaName`: the name of the schema to apply to the input FHIR bundle, the schema will either map FHIR -> FHIR or
  FHIR -> HL7
- `customerStatus`: only applies to HL7 receivers; this will value `MSH-11-1` with `T` when present
- `translation` only applies when converting from FHIR to HL7
    - `useTestProcessingMode`: this will value `MSH-11-1` with `T` when present
    - `convertPositiveDateTimeOffsetToNegative`: when true and a date contains `+0000` as the offset covert it
      to `-0000`
    - `useHighPrecisionHeaderDateTimeFormat`: covert all dates to `yyyyMMddHHmmss.SSSSxx`
    - `truncationConfig`: configures how truncation will be performed for HL7 fields
        - `truncateHDNamespaceIds`: special handler for specifically truncating HD datatypes
        - `truncateHl7Fields`: HL7 fields that should be truncated to the maximum length in the spec
        - `customLengthHl7Fields`: HL7 fields that should get truncated to a length specified by the receiver

### Transforms

The `schemaName` setting specifies transforms that will be applied to the FHIR bundle before being sent to the batch
step and either transform a FHIR bundle or convert a FHIR bundle into HL7; this is dependent on the format the receiver
has set.

The two kinds of transforms work the same at a high level. The schema enumerates a series of element that

- contains a FHIR path to the resource that needs to be transformed
- a condition specifying whether the resource should be transformed
- how the resource should get transformed; a resource can be transformed either by setting it to a value or applying a 
FHIR function

The primary difference between the FHIR and HL7 schemas is that the HL7 converter has special handling for converting
a FHIR resource into an HL7 segment or component.

For more details, consult the [transform design doc](../design/design/transformations.md).

#### Custom FHIR functions

In order to support custom business logic, the transform code is extensible and allows for creating custom functions
that can then be used while defining schema elements. One example of this is converting a date timestamp to a numerical
age.

See [CustomFHIRFunctions.kt]((https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/blob/acbaddc2d6a3f7da06ee99ead34c6ee4f05e9572/prime-router/src/main/kotlin/fhirengine/translation/hl7/utils/CustomFHIRFunctions.kt#L22))
for more examples

#### Extending schemas

In order to support receivers that would like small customizations to the bundles or HL7 messages they receive, schemas
can be extended and overrides applied without having to duplicate a whole schema. A current example of this is that
California specifies receiving HL7 ORU_R01 messages that mostly match the conversion specified by the base spec, but has
the
datetimes changed to be PST.

#### De-identification

There is limited support for de-identification in the universal pipeline by applying the RADx_MARS-base-deidentified.yml
schema for a receiver, which performs de-identification according to the RADx_MARS spec.

## How it works

This step is triggered when a message is placed on the `translate` message queue. The receiver is read from the message
and the FHIR bundle is downloaded and then converted into a FHIR bundle ready for the receiver or HL7, using the
configured `schemaName`.
That report is then uploaded to azure and a batch task is inserted into the database

### Retries

There is no custom retry strategy for this step. If an error occurs during this step, the message is re-queued up to
five
times before being placed in the poison queue.
