Overall Status Definitions

Received - A Submission is on this status from the moment it's accepted into our system until all routing is calculated for it


Once routing is finished, the submission status switches to a different set:
* Not Delivering - Either no Destinations were found for the submitted data, or all items were filtered out 
* Waiting to Deliver - At least one Destination has been found and at least one item has successfully passed all filters, but no reports have been delivered yet.
* Partially Delivered - At least one Destination has had its report delivered, and at least one more Destination is expected to have a report delivered to it.
* Delivered - All Destinations that were expected to receive a report have had theirs delivered.





May need to add proposal for new statuses?
