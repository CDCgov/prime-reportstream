## Data Restore
This section shall cover strategies for restoring data and various Azure services when the need arises.

### Conditions Requiring Blob Restore

#### Storage Failover

If the storage account becomes unavailable in the East US region, you can initiate a failover to promote the secondary
storage location for use within the production system.

More in [these Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance).

1. In the Azure Portal navigate to the storage account and click the `Geo-replication` blade.
2. Click the `Prepare for failover` button to initiate a failover to the secondary storage location.


### Storage Restore

If an entire storage account gets deleted it can be recovered within 90 days as long as an identically-named storage
account has not been created.

#### Actions to Mitigate

1. To restore a storage account, contact the CDC AD helpdesk.
2. At a minimum, provide the subscription ID and the name of the storage account that needs to be restored.  If
   possible, a resource ID would provide the user with the most information.


### File Restore

If a file is inadvertently deleted or edited, a previous version of the file can be made the current version within the
60-day retention window.

More in [these Azure docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-restore-files-from-vm)

1. In Azure Portal navigate to the appropriate blob container under the `Containers` blade.
2. If a file was deleted, toggle on the `Show deleted blobs` button to be able to see it.
3. Click the deleted or edited file to be restored.
4. Click the `Versions` tab.
5. In the options for the correct version of the file, click `Make current version` to restore the file to the
   appropriate point in time.

## DB Failover restore
### Database Failure Conditions

In the event of an extended PostgreSQL server outage there are two options to restore service. The quickest and most
complete is to promote the read-replica server to a read/write replica. You can also provision a new server from a
point-in-time backup.

In either case you'll need to re-configure any necessary resources (i.e., the Function App and Metabase, at a minimum)
to connect to it. You should do this through Terraform to ensure the configuration is sticky, but you may want to first
test by editing the value in the Azure Portal.

[these Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-read-replicas?msclkid=186f9575ac6d11eca07f9c72ead6d20d#failover-to-replica).


#### Promote Read Replica to Read/Write

NOTE: This action is not reversible, so be certain that you want to do this.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the PostgreSQL server that has read/write capabilities.
2. In the `Replication` blade, click the `Stop Replication` button. This will promote the read-replica to a standalone
   read/write instance.
3. Update the connection strings for any resources requiring database access.
4. NOTE: Performance may be degraded if your compute resources are in a different region than your database, so you may
   need to adjust any alert settings.


#### Provision New Server From Backup

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the PostgreSQL server that has read/write capabilities.
2. In the `Overview` blade, click the `Restore` button.
3. Select the date and time to which to restore a new uniquely named server to.
4. Click `Ok` to provision the new server from the point-in-time backup.
