# CDC ELIMS Metabase Queries

These are source controlled copies of queries that we have provided to the CDC ELIMS as troubleshooting tools during the
onboarding process.  They exist as questions in both the staging and production instances of metabase in a
dedicated folder.

They are kept in source control in case they get edited in metabase so that we can easily get back to a working query.

**Please note that the contents are not valid SQL as they contain metabase specific syntax.**
