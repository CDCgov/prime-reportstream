## Example ReportStream client/sender auth code, in python

This directory contains a python example of how to connect to ReportStream as a sender.

### How to run this python example

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- pipenv python package manager
- Python packages `PyJWT` and `cryptography`

#### Setup

1. Install pipenv using [their instructions](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)
    <details>
      <summary>Windows</summary>

      ```bash
      python3.exe -m pip install --user pipenv
      ```
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Linux or Mac</summary>

      ```bash
      python3 -m pip install --user pipenv
      ```
    </details>
       
2. Install python dependencies using pipenv. From inside the `generate-jwt-python` directory:
    <details>
      <summary>Windows</summary>
    
      ```bash
      python3.exe -m pipenv install
      ```
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Linux or Mac</summary>
    
      ```bash
      python3 -m pipenv install
      ```
    </details>

3. Then in `generate-jwt.py`, make these two changes:
    1. Change `my_client_id` to be your unique client-id string, as given to you by the ReportStream team back in Step 1.
    2. Point the `my_rsa_keypair_file` to be the path to your generated rsa keypair pem file.

#### Run

Launch a shell and run it:

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

  ```bash
  python3.exe -m pipenv shell
  python .\generate-jwt.py
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Linux or Mac</summary>

  ```bash
  python3 -m pipenv shell
  python ./generate-jwt.py
  ```
</details>

## Here's what this example is doing

### Steps to Authenticate with ReportStream, using Tokens

Authentication is done in three steps.   Details are found in the ReportStream-Programmers-Guide.docx, in https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/tree/master/prime-router/docs, but here is a quick outline:

#### Step 1:  Prior to submission, send your public key to ReportStream

- Prior to connecting to the endpoint, youâ€™ll create a public/private keypair, and send the public key to ReportStream.
- ReportStream will give you back a unique client-id for you to use.
- You only need to do this step once, not every time you submit. 
- This example does not include this step -- you'll need to contact ReportStream directly for this step.

#### Step 2:  At the Time of Submission, generate a signed JWT using your private key

- The `generate-jwt.py` program here in this folder is an example of how to do that.

#### Step 3:  Send the signed JWT to ReportStream, to get a temporary bearer token

- When run the, `generate-jwt.py` program prints out an example of what this looks like.

#### Step 4:  Use the temporary bearer token to send data to ReportStream

- When run the, `generate-jwt.py` program prints out an example of what this looks like.
