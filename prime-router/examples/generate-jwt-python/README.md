### Steps to Authenticate with ReportStream, using Tokens

Authentication is done in three steps.   Details are found in the ReportStream-Programmers-Guide.docx, in https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/tree/master/prime-router/docs, but here is a quick outline:

#### Prerequisite
- Python 3
- PyJWT module (`python3 -m pip install PyJWT`)
- cryptography moddule (`python3 -m pip install cryptography`)

#### Step 1:  Prior to submission, send your public key to ReportStream

- Prior to connecting to the endpoint, youâ€™ll create a public/private keypair, and send the public key to ReportStream.
- ReportStream will give you back a unique client-id for you to use.
- You only need to do this step once, not every time you submit. 

#### Step 2:  At the Time of Submission, generate a signed JWT using your private key

- The `generate-jwt.py` program here in this folder is an example of how to do that.

#### Step 3:  Send the signed JWT to ReportStream, to get a temporary bearer token

- When run the, `generate-jwt.py` program prints out an example of what this looks like.

### How to set up prior to running `generate-jwt.py`

Working in this folder, follow the setup steps in
      https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-handle-jwt-in-python/
prior to running generate-jwt.py

### How to run `generate-jwt.py`

In `generate-jwt.py`, make these two changes:
- be sure to change `my_client_id` to be your client-id string, as given to you by the ReportStream team.
- point the `my_rsa_keypair_file` to be the path to your generated rsa keypair pem file.

Then run it:

```
python3 ./generate-jwt.py
```

### Further documentation

- Your main source of documentation should be the ReportStream-Programmers-Guide.docx, in https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/tree/master/prime-router/docs.
- If python is not your cup of tea, then an example for how to generate a sender token, written in kotlin, can be found in function `generateSenderToken` in https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/blob/master/prime-router/src/main/kotlin/tokens/SenderUtils.kt
- Our implementation is based on these standard guidelines for the FHIR community:  http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html
- Documentation meant mainly for ReportStream operations personnel can be found here:  https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/blob/master/prime-router/docs/playbooks/how-to-use-token-auth.md
- Documentation on our token auth implementation (meant for ReportStream coders, but might be of general interest) is found here:  https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream/blob/master/prime-router/docs/proposals/0001-authentication.md
